# BEHAVIORAL DESIGN PATTERNS

# Chain of Responsibility Pattern

The Chain of Responsibility pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to pass a request along a chain of handlers. Each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it along the chain. This pattern decouples senders and receivers of requests.

# Command Pattern

The Command pattern is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all the information about the request. This transformation lets you parameterize methods with different requests, delay or queue a request's execution, and support undoable operations.

# Interpreter Pattern

The Interpreter pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a grammar for interpreting a language and provides an interpreter to parse sentences in that language. It is useful when you need to interpret a language or a grammar.

# Iterator Pattern

The Iterator pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. It allows you to traverse elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation.
