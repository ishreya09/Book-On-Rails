# STRUCTURAL DESIGN PATTERNS

- Structural design patterns provide different ways to create a class structure, for example using inheritance and composition to create a large object from small objects.

# Adapter
- The Adapter pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces.

# Facade Pattern
- The Facade pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex system of classes, interfaces, and objects. It hides the complexities of the system and provides an interface to the client using which the client can access the system.

# Proxy Pattern
- The Proxy pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder object to control access to another object. It allows you to create a class that represents the functionality of another class.

# Flyweight Design Pattern
- The Flyweight pattern is a structural design pattern that minimizes memory usage or computational expenses by sharing as much as possible with related objects. It is used to reduce the number of objects created and to decrease memory footprint and increase performance.
